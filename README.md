ESVBibleWorkflow V 0.2
================

The verse lookup part of this workflow copies verse(s) from the online ESV bible web service to your clipboard

The keyword lookup displays verses from the bible that contain your keyword, and you can choose which verse to copy to the clipboard

I'll be adding a good amount of options and flexibility to this app in the future.

1) To use the verse lookup utility, type in 'ESV' at the Alfred Prompt, with arguments as --- Book Chapter:Verse ---

Ex: ESV John 1:1

This should lead to a notification stating the verse, and also the verse should be copied to the clipboard

2) To use the keyword lookup utility, type in 'ESVS' at the Alfred Prompt, with arguments as --- Word Word Word...---

Ex: ESVS Before the Foundation

This should lead to a dropdown menu of verses that contain this keyword phrase. At the moment, it will also show choices that contain the word in any of the words in the verse: example being wept IN swept

Please email me if you have any feedback/questions/suggestions!
