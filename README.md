ESVBibleWorkflow
================

A workflow to copy verses from the online ESV bible web service to your clipboard


I'll be adding a good amount of options and flexibility to this app in the future.

To use this workflow, type in 'ESV' at the Alfred Prompt, with arguments as Book Chapter:Verse

Ex: ESV John 1:1

This should lead to a notification stating the verse, and also the verse should be copied to the clipboard
